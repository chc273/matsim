# Graph Networks for Predicting Materials Properties

MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) is an implementation of DeepMind's graph networks[1] for universal machine learning in materials science. We have demonstrated its success in achieving very low prediction errors in a broad array of properties in both molecules and crystals (see preprint of our paper ["Graph Networks as a Universal Machine Learning Framework for Molecules and Crystals"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05055)[2])

The notebook gives an example about how the QM9 molecule data set is handled. The code is available at [https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/megnet](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/megnet).
